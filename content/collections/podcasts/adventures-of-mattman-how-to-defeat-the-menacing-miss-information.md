He is defeated by doing things like writing down some routines of what time you plan to go to bed and what time you plan to wake up. That way you don’t have to rely on sleeping medication in order to fall asleep quickly.'

        text: "Dangerous to the consumer who wants honest third-party neutral information about the stuff they’re shopping for and dangerous because that information given in such a way could cause consumers to purchase from large franchises that spell out extinction for small independent, family-owned, ma and pa retailers.\_"

        type: text
        text: "These websites used to be what they claim to be. But now she buys them and they promote her sleep products. You see, Google charges quite a lot if you want to be a business and be at the top of search results for things like “Best Mattress For Side Sleeping.” But they don’t have the same pay system setup for websites that rate health products.\_\_"

        text: "Not only that, reviews on Google searches look very confusing nowadays because large chains can pay for their reviews to come through services that display reviews for 50 stores as if it were just the location down the street.\_"

    content:
      -
        type: text
        text: "Your local independent retail store may have 50 while the big chain has 500. And shoppers don’t see that the big chain’s 500 reviews are spread across several states and give almost no real information about the shopping experience in their town. Add up all the big chain stores individually and they’re probably much like yourself in the 20 to 50 range.\_"

        type: text
        text: 'One of the reasons they’ve gone to Google is because maybe somebody in their close personal network didn’t give them a recommendation. If their close friend had shopped with you and received an over-the-top customer experience, when she finds out about her friend’s experience, the need for Google is significantly reduced. The need for doing as much research is also lessened.'
