We provided a bed to somebody who didn’t have one. The need to help others as I helped my friend stuck with me.\_"

In a post covid world, their supplier had disappeared, and they asked us for our help and I said yes. At the time, I figured I’d be in trouble. They needed a lot of beds. But the cosmos have this funny way of leading you. Guiding you, if you will.'

I left my childhood, school, and college communities back in Illinois. At some point in helping those around us, I realized I’m longer a stranger to the place I live. I’m no longer a transplant.

I asked Keith for a statement about his local partnerships and he wrote: ”We have hundreds of businesses that back our mission. Some of the annual sponsors who have gone above and beyond in 2021 are J Signs & Graphics, PCS Pro Contracting Services, Elite Roofing, and Air Specialties of Pinehurst. They are ecstatic to commit for 2022 and 2023 as well. These businesses have helped us get families off the floor with their contributions. They believe in what we do and share the values behind why we do it. Investing in your community is key.”'
