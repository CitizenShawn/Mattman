Personally, I do not have this problem. Or at least not frequently. There have been days where I know tomorrow has a HUGE event I’ve been anticipating for months. Like when the Movie “Dune” came out last year. Hardly slept a wink the night before that one!'

        text: '-Avoid screens, news, and social media 30 minute before bed. This plants tiny seeds of active brain syndrome when you start winding down. You’ll start thinking up things to think about. Avoiding screens not only helps your body build up melatonin on it’s own, but also keeps your mindset and thoughts clear and present.'

Don’t be yelling at your kids while they’re on sugar highs misbehaving in public while you can’t control your own habit and get awful sleep the night before!'

But unless that melatonin you are taking is prescribed to you, you shouldn’t be eating hormones like candy without a doctor’s supervision.
