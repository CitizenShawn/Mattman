        text: 'A couple contributing factors to sleeping great lately is knowledge of nutrition in regards to sleep. For a long time I focused on my bedtime and wake up habits. So much so that I wasn’t getting huge results from changes I thought would improve my sleep. After reading about what nutrition helps my body get better quality sleep, I made some changes.'

        text: "Another unexpected reason is we rearranged the bedroom and I switched sides with my wife. The urge to change came out of nowhere but we are both happier with the new cozy bedroom setup. OH, and we used to have two dogs sleeping in bed with\_us all night. But they now sleep in their own beds. This was incredibly difficult to\_convince my better half to do. However, we have less interruptions during the night. Last but not least, I joined a gym and work out 30 minutes three times a week. More activity during the day can lead to more metabolic activity at night. And with better nutrition, I’m seeing pant sizes I haven’t seen in 15 years."
