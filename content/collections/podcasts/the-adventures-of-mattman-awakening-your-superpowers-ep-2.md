Do you have a fitness goal you are trying to reach?\_ Let us focus on awakening your superpower for that specific event and plan one week in advance!\_"

        text: "So, here’s an example: My normal spontaneous routine is to go to bed around 11 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m.\_My maximum sleep cycle count is 28 per week.\_ And because everything always goes as planned, one night I got distracted gaming with my buddies and I stayed up until 1 a.m.\_ Another morning my neighbor banged their garbage cans and woke me up at 5 a.m.\_ Now my cycle count max is 24.\_ And more bad news, it can drop even lower.\_ But we’re looking for superpowers so I’m writing a sleep schedule for myself.\_I will go to bed at 9:30 p.m. and wake up at 5 a.m.\_My maximum sleep cycle count is now 35.\_Same distractions occur and I’m down to 31.\_ I’ve added more sleep cycle potential and also during the peak benefit hours.\_That’s how you unlock superpowers!"

        text: "Here is my favorite reason to try and get as many sleep cycles as I can.\_ Do you think the Super Villains stay up 24/7? How do you think they awaken their own negative energy to go out and disrupt the lives of all of us?\_ Not on an empty tank… that’s for certain!\_\_"

Or the Pandemic and Political Energy Vampires posting negativity on social media and leeching from your sleep cycles. But maybe you don’t face off against the same Villains as I do.'

Maybe it is a competitor in your market.\_ I guarantee you they are also working hard, training hard, and trying to become more powerful by the day!\_ The old saying goes “What do you have to lose?” Potential. Power. Opportunity. Your sleep matters!\_\_"

        text: "When you look at your calendar and you see that time blocked off for sleeping, look at it with a new perspective. It is not just going to bed.\_ It is supercharging.\_ It is not wasting time or taking up precious productivity hours. It is accelerating the speed at which you perform critical tasks.\_ Sleep is a catalyst to the ideas and actions that drive you. Fill your tank with high octane fuel!\_ Awaken your superpowers and show your villains who the superhero really is!\_\_"
