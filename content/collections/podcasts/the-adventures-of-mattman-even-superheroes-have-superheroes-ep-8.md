Except instead of you and ten of your neighbors on the call, it’s me and ten buddies from across the globe and we’re all playing video games together. In case anybody is curious, our main game of choice is called Path of Exile and we play the Hardcore League.'

Dan used Discord’s live streaming feature to show Mike the water problem and see if he could tell him how to fix it. Turns out he couldn’t help him; Dan needed a plumber.\_"

Mike knows I work for a mattress and furniture company, so he offered to buy Dan a mattress. In Mike’s words “I don’t want to do this because I pity him. I know he needs this like he’s my brother. The emotion comes from somewhere else.”'

We were looking for a full-size mattress for a 22-year old dude of average size and weight. Something that would be awesome and long term.\_"

They got it all ready and three days later, Dan had a full sleep system. He had a mattress, a metal platform frame, protector, sheets, and a pillow!\_ BOOOOOOMM-Shakala!!! (Play some vuvuzela horns like somebody just scored a goal #LOL)."

This is an amazing time to be a part of the mattress industry! The internet is an interesting thing when you look at the connections it can create. And in today’s world, of all days, we could help!"

His plumbing issue got fixed after a couple of days so the mattress arrived right on time and in case it ever happened again, now he was off the floor with the platform frame from Malouf so his mattress wouldn’t get wet. But there’s more to this story. I also checked with Dan after he had slept on the mattress.'

But I didn’t know he had grown up in foster care. And the reason he slept in a pile of blankets on the floor was because his last few foster homes never gave him a mattress to sleep on. That’s just what he thought a bed is. My worldview shattered when he said that. I was speechless. I did not realize this was the case when Mike sent me that original message.'

You guys are the real superheroes.'

Doing good for others helps tuck me in and prepare me for a good night’s rest. I can’t be exceptional tomorrow without a good night’s sleep tonight.'
