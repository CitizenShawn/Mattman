First impressions with a new product that we say takes weeks to break in and may not be comfortable right away.\_ You wonder how anybody can have a great night’s sleep on dusk one."

But when the new $2,500 bed doesn’t knock their socks off because they had no idea drinking caffeine at 7 p.m. made it so much harder to fall asleep, whose problem is that? They had no idea working in their bedroom creates muscle memory, so your brain associates work stress with going to bed. They had no idea staring at a bright phone screen for hours up until the point they shut their eyes is like drinking coffee up until the point they shut their eyes.\_"

The mattress was delivered to their bedroom but it may as well have been set up under a fireworks display or in a bouncing car.\_"

If you can’t stand reading, try audiobooks or watch videos. Seeking out information about sleep and applying what you learn to your own life will help you grow. And it will give you the best chance to teach your customer and help them become aware. That awareness will help them awaken their superpowers locked inside them!'

        text: "Congratulations, you sold that mattress! It got delivered right on time. They are super excited to try their new bed. So much so they changed their bedtime routine in honor and preparation for their first night’s sleep. You told them about how cool sheets help them fall asleep faster and they bought those from you and put them on the mattress. You had told them about no screens, so they put their phones down 30 minutes before bed.\_ You told them about caffeine, and they held to a caffeine curfew of 2 p.m. You also told them about how important it is to have a dark room so they fixed their drapes and now they cannot see that annoying streetlight all night long. They crawl into bed and fall asleep right away.\_ They got four sleep cycles when they used to get two. You just doubled the amount of sleep on the first night. They have one of the best night’s sleep they can remember.\_ And you were the person to help them wake up and feel better, more alive! \_\_"
