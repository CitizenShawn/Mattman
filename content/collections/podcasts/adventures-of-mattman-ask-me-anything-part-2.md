While this sounds dangerous, I honestly have some great questions and I wanted to share them with you guys! At these events, when these people approached, I asked them to give me a question about waking up and one about going to sleep.'

If you time it right—and this takes some practice—you won’t need alarm clocks. I know because I haven’t used one in a year or more.\_\_"

Make this a habit now and months down the line and you will see an improvement in how quickly you fall asleep and how deeply you remain asleep.\_ Don’t be looking at your screens when you wake up in the middle of the night to use the potty. Your crypto can wait until the morning!"

I’ve shifted it from my original 9:30 p.m. because it is light much later. As a result, my caffeine curfew is 10 a.m, so as long as I slam a Dunks prior to 10 a.m., I’m all good!\_\_"

Set it for 6:40 a.m. and when it goes off, you get up! Setting early alarms and snoozing is costing you more than it’s reminding you.\_"
