        text: "A: You know what, this is extremely relevant because it changes! In case the readers don't know, there's a Sleeping Bandit, leader of the Sleep Stealing Bandits. And he has recruited his team consisting of Miss Information, Tyrano-snore-us Rex, and the Caffeine Chameleon. These are the big four. In the past few months, the Caffeine Chameleon has had me on the struggle bus."

        text: "Problem is that with enough caffeine and with a solid daily habit of drinking it, your energy deficit grows larger. Recently I've struggled with an early bedtime because I've taken two trips to the West Coast with crazy time zone changes. I couldn't reset my sleep schedule and it drove me crazy. Then Lent happened! Just like last year, I gave up caffeine for Lent again! Ash Wednesday and Easter! The first three or four days were miserable. But then I noticed how genuinely tired I was at night. Suddenly, my early bedtime came right back and I felt more refreshed in the morning."

        text: "I hadn't realized how much caffeine I was consuming. Most people I talk to make a joke like this. \"How do you prevent a murder? Don't take my coffee away and I don't have to kill you.\" Then they laugh! I don't. To me it's not funny and I am grateful I can walk away from caffeine. Just like last year, suddenly I can see the Chameleon again. In my habits and in the habits of those around me. And I honestly feel less stressed and jittery during the day."

        text: "I love learning this over again in 2022. If you aren't able to change your sleep habits, you may have to change something about yourself. Don't expect different results with the same situation. I hope I figure this out faster next time so I don't lose as many sleep cycles. The Caffeine Chameleon is not an easy foe to defeat."
