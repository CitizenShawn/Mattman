Between the iCloud, other clouds, and technology in general, today’s gadgets are more like magic every day. It takes a good night’s sleep just to keep up with the pace of improvements all around us. Some improvements have been predicted by movies and TV shows.'

But in the meantime, what do you think of when you hear the words sleep tracker? Are you using one? Do you sell an adjustable base that comes with one? Yeah, I’m talking to you Tempur retailers!\_"

Trackers create awareness of how and why you sleep good or bad. They’ve only been around for seven years or so.\_"

It’s an inception fence! The movie’s true sleep sci-fi comes in the form of lucid and not quite lucid dream states we can achieve. And they have control over their brains to hide and lock information away. But then you can also go find and unlock information all the same.\_"

According to Matthew Walker’s Master Class “The Science of Sleep,” “When you enter a dream state, you become flagrantly psychotic.” He continues that while dreaming we hallucinate, we’re delusional, time is distorted, and when we wake up we often forget what we dreamt about.\_"

        text: "If you experience any one of these things while you are awake, you are going to the doctor! But our brain prepares itself to go full immersion dream state for a reason. It imagines scenarios, replays important information, and connects short-term memories into the long term. The class continues with studies showing that dreams of traumatic incidents can be therapeutic and speed up recovery. Even relieve depression. And it’s the same sleep function that improves motor skills and muscle memory with sports. Including E-Sports.\_I said sports and I’m not leaving out the ones I follow!\_"

But the real secret is that the first impression is the best impression. You need to get a great night of sleep BEFORE you go into your lesson, brainstorming, or workout session.\_"

Big shocker here, but the eight-hour group did way better. And the thing we don’t get a measure of is how hardcore did either group maximize? That’s how you get exponential results!'

If your sleep cycles are the currency in which you pay for your body to perform each year, would you like to make an annual deposit of $1,456 worth of sleep cycles or $1,820? No matter how far you stretch your budget there, the bigger deposit will get you more bang for your buck! I can switch this analogy to burritos if that helps paint a better picture. Just text me.\_"
