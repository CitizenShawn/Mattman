        text: "I maintain a regular sleep schedule with a bedtime of 9:30pm and a wake up time of 5am. On a day I am given an extra hour, it's even more important to stick to my sleep routine. If I wake up on time and knock out my chores right away, I an spend the extra hour AND the rest of my day doing what I love to do the most, which is play video games and practice the drums!"

        text: "Overall, I am not a fan of daylight savings time changes. Do you know how hard it is to reset the circadian rhythm of a few people let alone 350+ million people? The entire country has to adjust their sleep schedules! It's a nightmare in my book. I know that not everybody will remember to change their clocks, wake up or get to bed on time."

        text: "But I can't change the rules so we have daylight savings time. Funny thing is I see so many people excited to get an extra hour in their day. I wonder if they truly understand what it means to maximize their sleep. When it takes moments, not minutes to fall asleep, you are giving yourself extra time to be awake tomorrow. If it takes you 20 minutes to fall asleep, a bedtime routine can help you eliminate the time spent waiting. What would you do with an extra 20 minutes everyday? If your answer is sleep, then it's very likely you do not sleep like a superhero. Because superheroes could use that extra time to do more good in the world! I'm interested to hear what you will do with your extra hour from daylight savings time this year. Text me at 704-706-2436."
