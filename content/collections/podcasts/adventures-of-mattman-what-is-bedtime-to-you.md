Sleep knowledge to help you fight off the villains like the Sleeping Bandit, who hopes you feel like you have no control over your sleep habits! If you have no control, you will need his big pharma products to induce sleep.\_"

        text: "Funny story, I’ve been struggling with my sleep lately.\_ It’s true. Since the pandemic shutdown, I have not traveled much. We all might not have traveled as much. Early in 2022, I took two trips that really knocked me off my game. The first was from North Carolina, my home, to Las Vegas Market. There’s a three-hour time difference between the two destinations.\_"

Both events are large national events and play a vital role in us being the experts in our industry. We meet the teams, see the brands, shop the products and find the best solutions for our customers’ needs.\_\_"

        text: "I was on the struggle bus! Back at home, I drank coffee on the daily, and unsweet tea in the afternoon or the occasional soda.\_I had grown numb to the effects of caffeine quickly. It seemed like I would never get back to my old routines."

        text: "Long story short, the Caffeine Chameleon had once again pulled the veil over my eyes. Just like last year, the first few days were miserable. I had a headache and walked around in a sour mood. When I got home from work, I would nap for an hour just to recoup. I felt drained. Day five rolled around and suddenly my stamina kept me up in the afternoon. And by 9:30 p.m., I was ready for bed!\_\_"

        text: "I’ve made the comment a few times that talking about the effect of alcohol on sleep is a whole episode in itself. I hold true to that statement and will one day break it down. Until then, know that drinking alcohol in the evening before bed may help you fall asleep, but it does not allow you to sleep deeply.\_ Alcohol and caffeine have opposite effects on our bodies with the same negative side effects on our nightly functions.\_"
