        text: "A: Yo!! I get asked this all the time in our store. Mattresses is easier to answer. We shoot for 8-12 years really good use. After a decade, our bodies change that that is a good time to assess the bed. Still sleeping pretty good? Keep going! Just protect your mattress with a waterproof protector so dust mites, molds and allergens don't grow over time."

        text: "Pillows are a bit different! Pillows are often used as long or longer than the mattress but the reality is polar opposite. Pillows should be changed every few years or upon sudden or significant neck soreness. Your neck is very important. It has a hard days work looking at screens, phones and pointing your head every which way all day. If you experience neck soreness and see a chiropractor, make sure your pillow isn't a contributing factor."

        text: "Most people grab a whatever pillow off the shelves of a big box store. But to me, pillow are a lot like stores. You have to get custom fit! Find one that fits your sleep position, your shoulder thickness, the length of your neck, and should also be matched and tested on a bed similar to yours at home. That last part isn't a factor people are generally aware of but I see it all day. Side sleepers with ultra plush mattresses may not need as thick of pillow as a side sleeper on a very firm mattress. How much your shoulder sinks into the bed is am important factor."
