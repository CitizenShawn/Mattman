I got Pfizer and I did have a bit of a reaction the day after my second shot. I think most people shared the experience to some degree.\_\_"

We go because our local community depends on our expertise and insights so they don’t have to spend days and weeks researching products from top to bottom. Instead, they trust us to do that homework for them. I can’t wait to go back to Vegas market in 2022!'

        text: "So all of these things factored into my decision to be somewhere around the 110-140 millionth adult to be vaccinated in the U.S. However, you don’t just get vaccinated and this problem goes away. While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are state-of-the-art, we have some old-school data from our annual flu shots and other vaccines to know that without a good night’s sleep, it isn’t as effective.\_"

        text: "You know what keeps me up at night? I think about how many people have gotten vaccinated and say to themselves “Oh well, I’m all set!!” Well, all of them for starters. But the sad news is, according to Dr. Walker’s Master Class “The Science of Sleep,” if you sleep six hours or less each night the vaccine could be up to 50% less effective. They test this on the folks who get the flu shot every year.\_"

Our lives are our own responsibility. I chose to plan out my sleep the week prior to my shots and a few days after. I want to be as immune as possible to Covid-19.'

        text: 'The science behind your body’s response is twofold. You need both your body to produce the reaction but to also have the ability to recognize the foreign agent. If you lack proper sleep, you’re increasing the risk for all diseases including, the Rhinovirus AKA the common cold. But also Covid and the two-week quarantine you’ll go through if you contract it.'

It’s up to you to bring your body ready to get the most out of the vaccine. The government and doctors aren’t in charge of your circadian rhythm, that’s all you!'
