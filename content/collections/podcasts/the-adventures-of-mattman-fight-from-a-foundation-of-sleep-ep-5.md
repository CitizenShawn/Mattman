Growing up, my little brother and I loved watching the Gladiators on Saturday night! The joust challenge has one a Gladiator on one pillar facing an opponent on the other. Each warrior gets a giant Q-tip to do battle. The first warrior to knock the other person off their platform wins.\_If you don’t know what I’m talking about, it’s worth a Google or Youtube search for the haircuts alone!"

        text: "Imagine you are the gladiator and you’re holding that jousting stick in your hands. The left puffy ball is your diet and the right puffy ball is exercise. Beneath you, the platform on which you balance to remain in the game is your sleep. When that opposing gladiator (which represents life) starts swinging their stick at you, how will you use diet and exercise effectively without a solid foundation beneath you?\_\_"

        text: "Keeping your balance is the single most important thing when fighting the joust.\_And you can’t just take hits.\_You’re supposed to strike back! In your daily routine, you need to be able to make good nutritional decisions and it is easier to make the right choice when you are well-rested. You need to have energy and drive from a solid sleep schedule to be more likely to choose the gym or your workout routine over the old habit of choosing not to. And sometimes, you need to push your own limits and start using the Q-Tip and make your opponent be the one-off balance!"

And in the first week, each day, put your best effort forward so you crystalize your good intentions and gain some small victories. Do the thing you want to do at an extremely high level of precision. Then reflect each night before bed about how you did it. Focus on how it makes you feel to accomplish that goal. Then get your rest and that short-term experience will link with the long-term ones. The long term will feel these new effects of positivity!\_"
