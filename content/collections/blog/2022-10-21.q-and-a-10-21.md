        text: "A: For the record, this was an actual question I got in the showroom on Saturday from a fan of the Sleep Superhero column. It is a breach of contract to tell a lie as a Superhero. This is a fantastic question to boot because we often take our health for granted. Not necessarily on purpose. It’s just so easy to do. And we typically don’t realize how good\_we have it until we find out there is a chance we aren’t going to have it anymore or worse,\_it’s gone..."

        text: "So, aging in place you say? What do I plan to do? I have learned from Sleep Sources like Matthew Walker’s Master Class “The Science of Sleep” and Shawn Stephenson’s Sleep Smarter, that sleep is harder to get as we age. I practice being in bed for 7.5 hours every night right now so if things change drastically, I am seeing the signs that something\_might be wrong with my health. And if I wake up after only four or five hours, I stay in bed and try to relax to get the last sleep cycle in if I can. Saying I only need five hours and I’m\_good is a mistake. It can literally shorten your life expectancy."

        text: "Next, I focus on my routine as I go to bed and as I wake up. Since my customer asked me,\_I decided to add picking up things on the floor around the bed and the stairs as part of my\_bedtime routine. I don’t want to trip on something in the dark. I want to master this habit before it’s too late! I will reduce the chances of an accident and therefore increase my odds of extended independence. And I also increase the odds of a happy marriage as theobstacles on the floor are my shoes and clothes. My wife is loving this one!"
