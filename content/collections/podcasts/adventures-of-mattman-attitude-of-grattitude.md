        text: "But as we set up his mattress set and some basic furniture, I could see how difficult it was for him to do chores. Picking up items on the floor, dusting, doing laundry, and the list goes on. Then I turn around and procrastinate doing my own chores because of some lame excuse like I feel like I deserve to relax more and shrug my chores off.\_"

        text: "As I have traveled the world and served in local charities, I have come to realize how special it is to be able to practice a consistent bedtime routine and a regular bedtime. It is very special to be able to plan out a wake-up time and then have 30 minutes to make coffee or tea and do meditation and reading. I really had no idea until these habits woke me up.\_"

I work at my habit to improve my sleep. And I find that those same improvements positively affect me while I am awake!\_"

        text: 'And speaking of Superheroes, the Dreams 4 All team in Pinehurst held a fundraiser to raise money to support the staff and services of Dreams 4 All. It was an amazing event! I saw our Tempur-Pedic Rep Casey Williams there, also Doug Stewart and Mark Kinsley from the FAM.news crew, and we raised a good bit of money to support the cause. If you would like to make a monetary donation to the Dreams 4 All Foundation that believes nobody deserves to sleep on the floor, please text us at 704-706-2436. You can text us if you would like to see about doing this in your local community as well! We are always looking for more superheroes to join the ranks!'
