Their team recovered from the 2020 shutdown, supplied us and many of their vendors with almost no delays until very late in the game of 2021.\_"

While I maintained my weight most of the year, I lost some of my momentum through October, November, and December. The challenge is to pick a weight you want to achieve and you have until April to get it done. If you don’t, you pay $500. I’ll see if I can get Greg at some point to join me and talk about the experience.\_"

I intend to continue producing content for the FAM.news team and for the worldwide audience of potential Sleep Superheroes out there. I have found that teaching and practicing the Game Plan for Better Sleep is my true calling. Having planned out 42 out of 52 weeks in 2021, I achieved more personal growth than ever before.\_"

        text: "Goal #1 I want to learn how to sew. What I really want to do is make my own cape but if that’s my goal, then that’s all I will accomplish. Instead, if I learn how to sew, I can make pockets, throw pillows, and more! Somebody who makes capes likely sews. So I need the habits of a seamstress or a tailor!\_\_"

        text: "Goal #2, I intend to get cardio exercise daily. Raising that heart rate! This is a tricky one for me because I had a hip replacement last year. Some folks get right back into it but I am a bit shy on the running and jarring motions quite yet. I really want to heal and be healed. However, if I wait any longer to prepare myself for activity I’ll spend even more time getting ready. So the time is now!\_"

A dude wearing a 14-pound wind-catching oven mitt-looking sleepsuit at a 5K early on a Saturday morning. You know what’s even more unexpected? That same dude walked faster than a third of the participants. Just enough speed to keep that cape animated!'

        text: "I know that I have saved more but I do not count the sleep challenges unless it’s been done three consecutive weeks. That makes it pretty hard. My number isn’t just frivolous willy nilly cycles. I only get the accreditation if I can confirm the person’s sleep habits over a 21 day period. And the point of this goal is to have lunch with the one and only Paul Rudd.\_"
