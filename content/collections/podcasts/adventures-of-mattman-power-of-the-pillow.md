        text: "To my fellow sleep associates out there, a percentage of your customers that purchase a mattress from you immediately go to one of the big box stores or perhaps a retail chain that rhymes with “head math and freeyond” to purchase a pillow.\_"

        text: "That statistic is relevant because there’s a need for the product. And oftentimes they’re shopping on price alone because they’ve already spent a lot of money on the mattress and box spring and don’t necessarily want to keep spending just to solve a problem.\_"

        text: "Have you ever had somebody who you worked with for a long time choosing the right mattress? They took it home and called you saying they’re not happy with it because their neck hurts? And did that person take a pillow from their old bed or perhaps just a random pillow off a shelf from somewhere with no expert guidance?\_"

        text: "Science tells us for every inch of your neck that is pushed out of a natural posture, it creates 10 lb of pressure on it. You know there’s this little bone up in your neck that your spinal cord goes through and attaches to your brain. It’s called the atlas.\_\_"

        text: "In my video game, the atlas is a map to the world in which I can smash monsters for loot. Without it I wouldn’t know where the monsters are to smash or can’t make a plan, I might just wander around aimlessly for hours doing nothing.\_\_"

        text: "You might have expensive pillows as a result of your research but that doesn’t mean the customer isn’t willing to buy it. Quite the opposite, we find that when we custom fit a person for a pillow and a mattress together there’s overall satisfaction of our products.\_ Our comfort guarantee rate goes down. And we offer money back guarantees on the pillows because we want to make sure they don’t regret their decision if it doesn’t meet their expectations.\_\_\_"

        text: 'So when your guests come into the store looking for a mattress, it is really important that you also figure out which pillow will work best for them. And give it to them to use during their shopping experience. This way when they go home and grab that ragged old pile of rags to put under their head, they have context. They may not realize that the nine-year-old pillow that they’ve hung on to because that’s the only one that was comfortable at the time is worn out.'

        text: "The power of the pillow is significant because of how important everything you’re storing in your brain is for your body. Some people scoff or shun away my suggestion at the expensive pillows and I’m okay with that. I at least have to try because I believe that with the right pillow and the right mattress and the right sheets, your sleep experience can be so awesome that it unlocks super powers inside your body.\_"

        text: "He was a guestimated 13 human years old. He didn’t come with a name, so we shouted names for several hours. We had to shout because he was somewhat deaf. He didn’t respond to any of the three hundred names we called out so we named him Red Dog because he was redder than the previous Pomeranian, Jesse.\_ He became known to me as Old Man Red."

        text: "It was his fault for sleeping there, but that’s just how he was. So my wife asked me to take him to work. She needed a break. That was the best suggestion she ever made. Red Dog loved the showroom and he was great with people. He loved our customers and our employees.\_ We even had this extra pillowcase with a Sweet Dreams logo on it and Greg’s mom, Sharon Jean, fashioned it in such a way that he could wear it as a cape!\_\_"

        text: "During the shutdown, life wasn’t fun and I wasn’t suiting up as a sleep superhero. But Red Dog with a cape was in a different zone of social etiquette. Me parading around as a sleep superhero didn’t fit the national dialogue. But Red Dog prancing around in a cape was welcomed universally. People lit up when they saw his cute costume. And thus he became a pillow pupper.\_\_"

But just because I hadn’t achieved it yet doesn’t mean I stop trying. I learned I have to keep trying because it could happen in a year, in ten years, or right before I die of old age on my bed when I’m 90. But if greatness is the last thing I achieve, then it would be worth it!\_\_"

I encourage anybody who has stress issues or deals with emotional mismanagement that you should rescue a dog. They need our help just as much as we need theirs. The right furry friend can help set you on a path that is better tomorrow than today'
