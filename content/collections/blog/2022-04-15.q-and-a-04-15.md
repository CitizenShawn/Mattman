        text: "A: Duuuude! Bedtime is very general and it doesn't mean the same thing to everybody. Do you mean my fall asleep time? The time I am supposed to be asleep by? I have found that bedtime can be a single action of getting into bed and falling asleep or a general time of the evening where you perform your routine. This spring and summer, I will have a fall asleep time of 10:30pm. It is a bit late but it stays light much later and I will be outside enjoying the evenings."

        text: "So now that my fall asleep time is planned out, I can use my bedtime routing to maximize the quality of sleep I get! Having a consistent bedtime routine will help you fall asleep quickly once you lay down. I don't like to wait too long to fall asleep just like I don't show up to the dinner table and wait 25 minutes to get hungry. I'm not letting those fries go cold! And waiting 20 minutes to fall asleep is losing precious time in my day."

        text: "Mu bedtime routine takes about 15 minutes. I start with taking our three dogs outside. I feed the cat and put her up in her three story princess palace. I tend to make a mess in the kitchen so I tidy it up and wipe the counters. I also drink a lot of water from the filtered water jugs in the fridge so I refill them. Then I brush my teeth and use the bathroom. If I happen to go to bed before my wife does, I make the bed. It's no much nicer when the covers are in place! My wife doesn't wake me up when she comes to bed. Pro-tip if your significant other wakes you with cover-yanking shenanigans every night, just make the bed! I turn on the fan, hop under the sheets and begin my sleep journey! If you need help establishing a bedtime routine, text me at 704-498-4451. I can give you feedback and direction! I'll be your personal Superhero Sleep Coach!"
