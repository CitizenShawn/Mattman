        text: "Some runners like to wear crazy pants, others wore turkey hats, and a few of us on the Dream Team suited up in our promotional mattress costumes leftover from a High School fundraiser earlier that year. For years we wanted to run the races with a twin size mattress strapped to our backs. Or maybe two of us could carry a king size mattress the whole race. The suits were an entertaining compromise!\_ We pinned Dream Team shirts to the back of each one to let people know “We are the Dream Team!”\_ It was a lot of fun!"

        text: 'Wearing the mattress suit had changed my pace. In previous years I started too fast and after a short stretch, I slowed to walk/run for the remainder of the 5k. The mattress suit slowed me down at the beginning. My initial pace never overwhelmed me and I trotted slow and steady from start to finish. Shaved 12 minutes right of the top.'

Like a superhero’s band of expert brethren, the Dream Team rushed to my aide with sleep tips. We had meetings to discuss developing a bedtime routine, a wake-up routine, and learned ways to fall asleep quickly, and ways to stay asleep for long periods of uninterrupted rest.\_"

But a good night’s sleep had awakened one of my superpowers, which is the ability to focus. I knew my pace. I knew what to expect. With a good night’s sleep, I could focus and push myself. I could reach new limits!\_ And that was the fun part of it. Every race was a different track and a different course. Regardless, I could perform at a higher level every time."
