I’ve already discussed light pollution and how that can affect our sleep habits. This is about landfill pollution. Wall-E style pollution. Real pollution and when you hear how many mattresses contribute to our carbon footprint and also to landfills, that information keeps me up at night!'

Yes, the customer can be threatened with return fees if they choose the wrong mattress with zero care of the consequences. And sure, we can cook up some crazy tech to monitor usage to guarantee cleanliness on returns to recycle the mattresses if they are brought back.\_ All of these are great ways to address the symptoms. But ladies and gentlemen of retail, it’s up to us to help that customer diagnose their ailments correctly. We’re the “doctors” in this analogy.\_"

Let’s just say my favorite vacation ever would be to go to Yosemite National Park and hike up a hill. I’ve got two sons ages eight and 12. And we also were kind of hoping for one more because my wife wants a girl. And my favorite thing for lunch is a triple XL pizza with all of the toppings plus extra meat and a butter cheese crust, please. Oh yeah, and last weekend the weather was nice out for the first time since spring began so we hit the trails up in Asheville North Carolina. It was amazing!'
