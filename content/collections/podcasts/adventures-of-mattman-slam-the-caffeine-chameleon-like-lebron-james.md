However, if you admit that you can’t get good sleep and then say coffee doesn’t affect you and you won’t even consider changing that habit, you have given up on yourself. Throw in the towel.'

Because chemical reactions often still occur even if you think it doesn’t and I would bet, I’d make a huge bet, that if you gave up caffeine for a significant amount of time you might find that you sleep better at night. I bet you would backpedal on that claim that caffeine has no effect on you.\_"

You know why people start drinking that stuff? Because they were tired and they wanted a boost. You want to maximize that thing you’re doing every day. You are probably working and under a ton of pressure to perform at a high level. Your boss is breathing down your neck for results.'

For the record, pointing out the flaw in the caffeine fiend’s logic has never yielded a change of mind right away. You see, the Caffeine Chameleon is really good."
