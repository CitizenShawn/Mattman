        text: 'A. I tell you what, the Sleeping Bandit has recruited a horde of villains like Tyrano-Snore-us Rex, king of the Dinosnores and the Caffeine Chameleon who disguises himself as a solution to your energy deficit. However, this summer, he has found himself a new recruit! Dr. Hue M.D. I like to call him Dr. Humid. Dr. Humid is a climatologist who specializes in disrupting your sleep by making your sleep space too hot or too cold.'

        text: 'The ideal room temperature for most sleepers is 68 degrees. Sleeping in that Goldilocks zone will ensure you maximize your sleep and potentially awaken your dormant superpowers. Dr. Humid knows if he can disrupt your sleep cycles, his buddies in big Pharma and in the caffeine industry make a killing off their products. But I believe you can do more with less. You can get more work done, be more productive, be more active and spend less on energy drinks, spend less on needless melatonin supplements and other sleep aids.'

        text: "The way sleep works, you core body temperature drops when you initially fall asleep. As the night goes on, it slowly rises. When it hits a certain temperature, you wake back up. If you sleep too cold or too hot, you'll never get the deep restful sleep you need. You can fight against Dr. Humid's shenanigans with things like: keeping your thermostat at the right temperature, use ceiling fans or a stand up oscillating fan in your bedroom, wear appropriate bedtime attire, use bamboo sheets that feel like yoga pants for your mattress and don't eat sugar 1-2 hours before bed (it's burns your metabolism hot!). And if it's your mattress that is to blame, check out our very own Lake Norman Chill mattresses at our stores. We specifically put temperature regulating fabric on them to help keep your body the right temperature all night long."
