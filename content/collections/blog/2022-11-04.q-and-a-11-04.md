        text: 'A: Yo dude! I love talking about gratitude! There is a lot to be grateful for everyday. You know, a lot of the time parents of young children say things like “Hah, I can never get a good night’s sleep because my kids share the bed and kick me all night.” Or they say things like “try sleeping through the night when your kids wake up screaming in their rooms or somebody wet the bed.” I personally don’t have kids but I try not to take the freedom that comes from my lifestyle for granted. So I sit down each week and write down my bedtime and wake up time. I write down my bedtime and wake up routines. And then throughout the week, I do all of those things the best I can.'

        text: 'Learning what other people value is a wonderful mind expanding experience. It iss a great way to gain perspective and live a better life. I used to hate my 40 minute commute until I visited Delhi in India. We drove the same distance and it took two and a half hours. What’s another couple minutes on my commute behind a slow paced vehicle?'

        text: 'The other thing is that without a good night’s rest, you may not be awake enough to fully grasp what special gifts God has given you. You need to be wide awake to see each day as an opportunity. So plan your bedtime and wake up time. Practice better sleep habits. And really see the gifts that are all around you. What is something you try not to take for granted? Text me at 704-498-4451. I’d love to hear from you!'
