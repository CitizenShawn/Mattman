        text: '. So the plan is to grab a cup of coffee or an energy drink at 3 p.m. to make it to the end of your shift. Fast forward six hours and it’s now 9 p.m. Fifty percent of the caffeine you drank is still swirling around in places that should be winding down. Fast forward a little further to 11 p.m., and 25 percent of that caffeine is still hanging out doing what it does best. And for the record, shots of tequila do not negate the effects of caffeine. (It’s actually much worse, but alcohol is a whole other episode!)'

        text: "So, now that you know what I know, I will share that up until February 17, 2021 I drank at least two cups and sometimes as many as five cups of coffee in a day. It was built into my routine for years and previous attempts to stop had proved unsuccessful. However, I have some new tools in the tool belt. Both Matthew Walker’s Master Class “Science of Sleep,” as well as the book “Atomic Habits” by James Clear on breaking and building new habits. And now I am proudly on the other side of the fence. Coffee-free and feeling great.\_"

I had a headache for two solid days.\_I still craved a warm cup of something, so I substituted it with caffeine-free tea.\_I cleaned up my coffee maker and put it in the garage, hidden away.\_Out of sight, out of mind!\_And while it was a rough start, I made extra sure to keep to a tight sleep routine schedule so if the moment came of weakness, I would make the right decision."

I’m not one to drink a lot of energy drinks, soda, or much else with caffeine, so by quitting coffee, I nixed a good 95 percent of caffeine from my daily diet.\_"

So, now I share with my customers that I have given up coffee as an icebreaker. The replies I get are hysterical and passionate! I see a lot of my previous mindset in the quick “no way, Jose” Heisman-hand at the mere mention of somebody stopping coffee consumption. But the reality is some of those people are shopping to get a better night’s sleep and no matter what I say, their caffeine consumption is not going to change.\_\_"

        text: 'The best solution I have come up with so far is to encourage a caffeine curfew. You need to establish a firm bedtime in order for your curfew to be effective. Set your caffeine curfew at least 10 hours before bedtime. The earlier your curfew is set, the more chance your brain has of making the right mixture of chemicals it’s normally supposed to produce that send your body signals it’s time for bed. Even if caffeine doesn’t stop you from falling asleep quickly, it definitely makes it harder to get the deep, rejuvenating sleep you need to awaken your superpowers.'
