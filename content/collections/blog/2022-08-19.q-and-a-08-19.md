        text: 'While we sleep like a superhero, our bodies regenerate. We heal ourselves! Our brains get washed and cellular waste is cleaned out. Short term memories mix and form with long term ones. This gives us the power of problem solving and divine inspiration! Our bodies move on hand nutrients to supply body systems, organs, and cells with everything they need. HGH growth hormone is released to repair and build upon torn muscle fibers making up stronger! And one of the best superpowers we get is breathing our trillions of carbon dioxide molecules that were oxidized from burned calories. 80% of our weight loss is expelled from the body through breathing those CO2 molecules out!'
