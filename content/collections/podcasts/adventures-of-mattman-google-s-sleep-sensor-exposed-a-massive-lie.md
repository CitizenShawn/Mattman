Or in our upstairs bedroom, the lights dim at 9:00 p.m. so that I’m not being blasted with bright light just before bed.'

If you’re not good with smart homes now, you will be akin to your grandparents when they were given their first smartphone. The learning curve is huge. Don’t be left behind.\_\_"

It sits right next to my bed so that it can use its radar to watch my sleeping patterns. It can also sense coughing and snoring, and an overall movement throughout the night.\_"

For instance, there are two dogs sleeping in bed with me and they move around throughout the night. I don’t know if it’s picking that up or if it’s picking me up when it says I sleep restlessly.\_"

Now full disclosure: I do have an injury that’s related to my back and leg and laying down for hours at a time doesn’t feel comfortable. It also doesn’t feel comfortable when I sit for or stand for too long either. I’m aware of the issue and it’s one of the reasons I set on this path of sleep maximization.\_"

Recently I’ve been putting the dogs to sleep in their crates at night when I know they’re not going to be cooped up the next day. After trying that multiple times I still got the restlessness result. And right at the same time every night—round 2-3 a.m., which is four or five hours after bedtime.\_\_"
